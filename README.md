Chris Warrick’s LaTeX To Do List
================================

I believe that the best way to manage things to do is an analog piece of
paper.  Those pieces of paper come out of a nicely crafted template,
courtesy of LuaLaTeX.

I do not want to use LuaLaTeX!
==============================

[An empty template][ghrel] is available on GitHub.  You can use it if
you do not want to customize it in any way.

(You only need a printer and A4 paper to use it.)

Documentation
-------------

See the official docs along with [the GitHub release][ghrel].

In this distribution
====================

* `todolist/todolist.tex` — the actual template
* `todoentries/todoentries.tex` — a sample file in which you can specify
  your todo list entries
* `LICENSE-TEX` — license for the `.tex` and `.lua' files (3-clause BSD)
* `LICENSE-PDF` — license for [the `.pdf` files on GitHub][ghrel]
  (**custom derivative** of the 3-clause BSD license)
* `README.md` — documentation
* `CHANGELOG.md` — all the changes between releases
